# HTTPS Mixed Content Fix

## Problem

**Mixed Content Error**: The production site (`https://dohblog.vercel.app/`) was trying to load images over HTTP from the backend (`http://backend-production-92ae.up.railway.app/media/...`), causing browser security warnings and automatic HTTPS upgrades.

**Error Message**:
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://dohblog.vercel.app/' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure element 'http://backend-production-92ae.up.railway.app/media/featured_images/The_Arowana_Mansion-1.webp'. 
This request was automatically upgraded to HTTPS.
```

## Root Cause

1. **Backend URLs**: Django was generating HTTP URLs instead of HTTPS in production
2. **Frontend Logic**: No HTTPS enforcement for production environments
3. **Missing Security Headers**: Django wasn't configured to force HTTPS in production

## Comprehensive Fix

### ✅ **1. Frontend Changes (`Blog-Website/src/utils/imageUtils.js`)**

#### Added HTTPS Enforcement Function
```javascript
/**
 * Force HTTPS for production URLs to avoid mixed content issues
 */
const forceHttpsInProduction = (url) => {
  // Only convert HTTP to HTTPS in production
  if (ENV.isProd() && url.startsWith('http://')) {
    return url.replace('http://', 'https://');
  }
  return url;
};
```

#### Updated Image URL Generation
```javascript
export const getImageUrl = (blog, type = 'blog') => {
  // ... existing logic ...
  
  // Ensure the final URL is HTTPS in production
  return forceHttpsInProduction(finalUrl);
};
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatically converts HTTP to HTTPS in production
- ✅ Preserves HTTP for local development
- ✅ Works with all image URL formats

### ✅ **2. Backend Changes (`backend/backend/settings.py`)**

#### Added Production HTTPS Settings
```python
# HTTPS/SSL Settings for Production
if not DEBUG:
    # Force HTTPS in production
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
    SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
    USE_TLS = True
    
    # Additional security settings
    SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
    SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
    SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # 1 year
    SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
    SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
    
    # Session security
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Forces HTTPS redirects in production
- ✅ Proper SSL header handling for Railway
- ✅ Enhanced security with HSTS
- ✅ Secure cookies and CSRF tokens

### ✅ **3. Backend Serializer Changes (`backend/blog/serializers.py`)**

#### Added HTTPS URL Helper
```python
def ensure_https_url(url):
    """
    Ensure URL uses HTTPS in production to avoid mixed content issues
    """
    if not settings.DEBUG and url and url.startswith('http://'):
        return url.replace('http://', 'https://')
    return url
```

#### Updated Image URL Methods
```python
def get_featured_image_url(self, obj):
    if obj.featured_image:
        request = self.context.get('request')
        if request:
            url = request.build_absolute_uri(obj.featured_image.url)
            return ensure_https_url(url)
        return ensure_https_url(obj.featured_image.url)
    return None
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Ensures all API responses use HTTPS URLs
- ✅ Works with Django's `build_absolute_uri()`
- ✅ Consistent across all image serializers

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files
```
Blog-Website/
└── src/
    └── utils/
        └── imageUtils.js              # ✅ Added HTTPS enforcement
```

### Backend Files
```
backend/
├── backend/
│   └── settings.py                    # ✅ Added HTTPS/SSL settings
└── blog/
    └── serializers.py                 # ✅ Added HTTPS URL helper
```

### Testing & Documentation
```
├── test_https_fix.py                  # ✅ Verification script
└── HTTPS_MIXED_CONTENT_FIX.md        # ✅ This documentation
```

## How It Works

### Production Flow
```
1. User visits https://dohblog.vercel.app
   ↓
2. Frontend requests blog data from API
   ↓
3. Django serializer generates image URLs
   ↓ ensure_https_url()
4. HTTP URLs converted to HTTPS
   ↓
5. Frontend receives HTTPS URLs
   ↓ forceHttpsInProduction()
6. Double-check: ensure HTTPS
   ↓
7. Browser loads images over HTTPS ✅
```

### Development Flow
```
1. User visits http://localhost:3000
   ↓
2. Frontend requests from http://localhost:8000
   ↓
3. Django returns HTTP URLs (correct for dev)
   ↓
4. Frontend preserves HTTP (correct for dev)
   ↓
5. Browser loads images over HTTP ✅
```

## Testing

### 1. **Run Verification Script**
```bash
python test_https_fix.py
```

**Expected Output**:
- ✅ All production API URLs should be HTTPS
- ✅ Frontend logic tests should pass
- ✅ No mixed content warnings

### 2. **Manual Testing**

#### Production Test
1. Visit: `https://dohblog.vercel.app`
2. Open browser DevTools → Console
3. Check for mixed content warnings
4. Verify all image URLs start with `https://`

#### Development Test
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Verify images load correctly
3. Check that URLs use `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. **Network Tab Verification**
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "Images"
3. Verify all image requests use HTTPS in production
4. Check for any failed requests (red entries)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Deploy Backend Changes**
```bash
# The backend changes will be automatically deployed to Railway
# when you push to the main branch
git add backend/
git commit -m "Fix: Add HTTPS enforcement for production"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Deploy Frontend Changes**
```bash
# The frontend changes will be automatically deployed to Vercel
# when you push to the main branch
git add Blog-Website/
git commit -m "Fix: Add HTTPS enforcement for image URLs"
git push origin main
```

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
1. Wait for deployments to complete
2. Visit `https://dohblog.vercel.app`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify images load correctly

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Mixed content warnings in browser console
- ❌ HTTP image URLs in HTTPS site
- ❌ Browser automatically upgrading HTTP to HTTPS
- ❌ Potential image loading issues

### After Fix
- ✅ No mixed content warnings
- ✅ All image URLs use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Clean browser console
- ✅ Reliable image loading
- ✅ Enhanced security with HSTS headers

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Mixed Content Prevention**
- Eliminates browser security warnings
- Prevents automatic HTTP→HTTPS upgrades
- Ensures consistent HTTPS usage

### 2. **Enhanced Security Headers**
- **HSTS**: Prevents downgrade attacks
- **XSS Protection**: Browser-level XSS filtering
- **Content Type Sniffing**: Prevents MIME confusion attacks
- **Secure Cookies**: Prevents cookie theft over HTTP

### 3. **SSL/TLS Best Practices**
- Forces HTTPS redirects in production
- Proper proxy SSL header handling
- Long-term HSTS policy (1 year)

## Troubleshooting

### If Mixed Content Warnings Persist

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   ```bash
   # Hard refresh
   Ctrl + F5 (Windows/Linux)
   Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
   ```

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Verify production environment detection
   console.log(window.location.hostname);
   # Should be: dohblog.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Verify API Responses**
   ```bash
   # Check API response in browser
   curl -s https://backend-production-92ae.up.railway.app/api/posts/ | jq '.results[0].featured_image_url'
   # Should start with: https://
   ```

4. **Check Django Settings**
   ```python
   # In Django shell
   from django.conf import settings
   print(f"DEBUG: {settings.DEBUG}")
   print(f"SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: {getattr(settings, 'SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT', False)}")
   ```

### Common Issues

1. **Still seeing HTTP URLs**: Check if DEBUG=False in production
2. **Images not loading**: Verify Railway backend is accessible over HTTPS
3. **Console errors**: Check for any JavaScript errors in image loading logic

## Monitoring

### Production Health Checks
1. **SSL Labs Test**: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
2. **Security Headers**: https://securityheaders.com/
3. **Mixed Content**: Browser DevTools Console
4. **Image Loading**: Network tab in DevTools

### Automated Monitoring
Consider adding:
- Uptime monitoring for HTTPS endpoints
- SSL certificate expiration alerts
- Mixed content detection in CI/CD
- Performance monitoring for image loading

## Conclusion

This comprehensive fix addresses the mixed content issue by:

- ✅ **Frontend**: Automatically converting HTTP to HTTPS in production
- ✅ **Backend**: Generating HTTPS URLs and enforcing SSL
- ✅ **Security**: Adding proper HTTPS headers and policies
- ✅ **Testing**: Providing verification tools and procedures

The solution is production-ready and follows security best practices while maintaining development workflow compatibility.
